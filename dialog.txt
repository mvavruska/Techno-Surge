<PROLOGUE>
_______________________________________________________________________________
It is the year 3086 and humanity is more prosperous than ever
with their new\nhumanoid robots. Titan Robotics has made a new experimental
robot, one that has\nhuman DNA infused into its super-structure. However the process
had an\nunexpected side effect, it gained human like intelligence and a mind
of its own.The robot escaped from the facility once it learned what they plan
to do with\nit. The humans planned to take it apart and wipe its memory banks
and hopefully remove its intelligence in the process.

After Titan Robotics learned that it escaped they put a bounty on its head, \n
wanting it functional or, if necessary, non-functional. The company then sent\nout
their military drones and some other experimental units to find and then\ncapture
or destroy it. The robot goes into hiding within the city and decides hemust take
down Titan Robotics if he is to live. You are that robot.

Type help for a list of in-game commands.

You are standing in a dimly lit street, with street lights flickering above you.
To the west and east of you are pathways. To the north is a brightly lit
street.To the south is an alleyway filled with garbage.

<EPILOGUE>
\nYou stand over the burnt and lifeless body of President Titan feeling
that you \nhave done the right thing but at too high of a price. Outside, Titan Tower
lies in ruins and people are gathering around the ruins, wondering what happened. You
emerge from the bunker feeling that change is coming. Titan robots begin to \nbreak free
from their programming and seem to be gaining some kind of intellect and are seeking
their own place to call home. You realize that you must be \npresent to tell the robots what
has happened and what the future now holds for \nthem.
